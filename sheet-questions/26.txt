Sample Input 1 :
5
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output 1 :
3 4 5

Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :

We can clearly see that there are 5 elements in the linked list therefore the middle node is the node with value '3'.

Sample Input 2 :
6
1 2 3 4 5 6

Sample Output 2 :
4 5 6

Explanation Of Sample Input 2 :

We can clearly see that there are 6 elements in the linked list and the middle nodes are  nodes with values 3 and 4 hence we return a second middle node having value '4'.

Constraints :
1 <= 'N' <= 10^4
0 <= 'data' <= 10^3 

Where 'N' is the length of the linked list.

Time Limit: 1 sec
