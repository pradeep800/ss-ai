Given an array ‘A’ of ‘N’ integers, find the majority elements of the array.
A majority element in an array ‘A’ of size ‘N’ is an element that appears more than floor(N / 3) times.
Note: The floor function returns the number rounded down to the nearest integer.
Note: Return the array of majority elements in sorted order.
Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 9 ‘A’ = [2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: The frequency of ‘1’ is 5, which is greater than floor(N / 3), hence ‘1’ is the majority element.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 1e3
-1e9 <= A[i] <= 1e9

Time Limit: 1-sec

Sample Input 1:
6
1 1 1 2 2 2

Sample Output 1:
1 2

Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
Input: ‘N’ = 6, ‘A’ = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]

Output: [1, 2]

Explanation: The frequency of ‘1’ and ‘2’ is 3, which is greater than floor(N / 3), hence ‘1’ & ‘2’ are the majority elements.

Sample Input 2:
1
4

Sample Output 2:
4
