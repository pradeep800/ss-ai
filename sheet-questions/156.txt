Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You have been given an undirected graph with 'N' vertices and 'M' edges. The vertices are labelled from 1 to 'N'.
Your task is to find if the graph contains a cycle or not.
A path that starts from a given vertex and ends at the same vertex traversing the edges only once is called a cycle.
Example :
In the below graph, there exists a cycle between vertex 1, 2 and 3. 


Note:
1. There are no parallel edges between two vertices.

2. There are no self-loops(an edge connecting the vertex to itself) in the graph.

3. The graph can be disconnected.

For Example :
Input: N = 3 , Edges =  [[1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3]].
Output: Yes

Explanation : There are a total of 3 vertices in the graph. There is an edge between vertex 1 and 2, vertex 2 and 3 and vertex 1 and 3. So, there exists a cycle in the graph.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 5000
0 <= M <= min(5000, (N * (N - 1)) / 2)
1 <= edges[i][0] <= N 
1 <= edges[i][1] <= N 

Time Limit: 1 sec 

Sample Input 1:
1
3 2
1 2
2 3

Sample Output 1:
No

Explanation Of Sample Output 1:
 The above graph can be represented as 


There are a total of 3 vertices in the graph.There is an edge between vertex 1 and 2 and vertex 2 and 3. So, there is no cycle present in the graph. 

Sample Input 2:
2
4 0 
4 3
1 4
4 3
3 1

Sample Output 2:
No
Yes
