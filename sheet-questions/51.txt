Suggest Edit
Given an integer array 'ARR' of size 'N' and an integer 'K', return all the subsets of 'ARR' which sum to 'K'.
Subset of an array 'ARR' is a tuple that can be obtained from 'ARR' by removing some (possibly all) elements of 'ARR'.
Note :
The order of subsets is not important. 

The order of elements in a particular subset should be in increasing order of the index.

Constraints:
1 <= 'N' <= 16
- (10 ^ 6) <= ARR[i] <= (10 ^ 6)
- 16 * (10 ^ 6) <= 'K' <= 16 * (10 ^ 6)

Where ‘ARR[i]’ denotes the value for ‘ith’ element of the array ‘ARR’ and 'K' is the given sum.

Time Limit: 1 sec.

Sample Input 1:
3
2 4 6
6

Sample Output 1:
2 4
6

Explanation Of The Sample Input 1:
For the array'ARR' = {2, 4, 6}, we can have subsets {}, {2}, {4}, {6}, {2, 4}, {2, 6}, {4, 6}, {2, 4, 6}. Out of these 8 subsets, {2, 4} and {6} sum to the given 'K' i.e. 6. 

Sample Input 2:
6 
5 -1 8 2 7 0
7

Sample Output 2:
-1 8 
-1 8 0 
5 2 
5 2 0 
7 
7 0
