Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given a directed graph having ‘N’ nodes. A matrix ‘EDGES’ of size M x 2 is given which represents the ‘M’ edges such that there is an edge directed from node EDGES[i][0] to node EDGES[i][1].
Find whether the graph contains a cycle or not, return true if a cycle is present in the given directed graph else return false.
For Example :
In the following directed graph has a cycle i.e. B->C->E->D->B.


Note :
1. The cycle must contain at least two nodes.
2. It is guaranteed that the given graph has no self-loops in the graph.
3. The graph may or may not be connected.
4. Nodes are numbered from 1 to N.
5. Your solution will run on multiple test cases. If you are using global variables make sure to clear them.

Constraints :
1 ≤ T ≤ 5

2 <= N <= 100
1 <= M <= min(100,N(N-1)/2)
1 <= EDGES[i][0], EDGES[i][1] <= N

Where ‘T’ is the number of test cases.
