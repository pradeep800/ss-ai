Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
Given a string 'S', you are supposed to return the number of distinct substrings(including empty substring) of the given string. You should implement the program using a trie.
Note :
A string ‘B’ is a substring of a string ‘A’ if ‘B’ that can be obtained by deletion of, several characters(possibly none) from the start of ‘A’ and several characters(possibly none) from the end of ‘A’. 

Two strings ‘X’ and ‘Y’ are considered different if there is at least one index ‘i’  such that the character of ‘X’ at index ‘i’ is different from the character of ‘Y’ at index ‘i’(X[i]!=Y[i]).

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= |S| <= 10^3

‘S’ contains only lowercase English letters.

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1 :
2
sds
abc

Sample Output 1 :
6
7

Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :
In the first test case, the 6 distinct substrings are { ‘s’,’ d’, ”sd”, ”ds”, ”sds”, “” }

In the second test case, the 7 distinct substrings are {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, “ab”, “bc”, “abc”, “” }.

Sample Input 2 :
2
aa
abab

Sample Output 2 :
3
8

Explanation Of Sample Input 2 :
In the first test case, the two distinct substrings are {‘a’, “aa”, “” }.

In the second test case, the seven distinct substrings are {‘a’, ‘b’, “ab”, “ba”, “aba”, “bab”, “abab”, “” }
