You have been given a Binary Tree of 'n' nodes, where the nodes have integer values. Your task is to return the In-Order traversal of the given binary tree.




For Example :
For the given binary tree:


The Inorder traversal will be [5, 3, 2, 1, 7, 4, 6].

Sample Input 1 :
1 2 3 -1 -1 -1  6 -1 -1

Sample Output 1 :
2 1 3 6

Explanation Of Sample Output 1 :
The given binary tree is shown below:


Inorder traversal of given tree = [2, 1, 3, 6]

Sample Input 2 :
1 2 4 5 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 2 :
5 2 3 1 4

Explanation Of Sample Output 2 :
The given binary tree is shown below:


Inorder traversal of given tree = [5, 2, 3, 1, 4]

Expected Time Complexity:
The expected time complexity is O(n).

Constraints :
1 <= 'n' <= 10^5
0 <= 'data' <= 10^5     

where 'n' is the number of nodes and 'data' denotes the node value of the binary tree nodes.

Time limit: 1 sec
