You are given a string 'str' of length 'n'.




Find the minimum number of partitions in the string so that no partition is empty and every partitioned substring is a palindrome.




Example :
Input: 'str' = "aaccb"

Output: 2

Explanation: We can make a valid partition like aa | cc | b.

Sample Input 1 :
aaccb





Sample Output 1 :
2





Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :
We can make a valid partition like aa | cc | b.





Sample Input 2 :
ababa





Sample Output 2 :
0





Explanation Of Sample Input 2 :
The string is already a palindrome, so we need not make any partition.





Sample Input 3:
aababa





Sample Output 3:
1





Expected Time Complexity :
You can submit a solution of time complexity O(n ^ 3) but also try to write the solution having complexity O(n ^ 2).





Constraints :
1 <= 'n' <= 100

Time limit: 1 second
