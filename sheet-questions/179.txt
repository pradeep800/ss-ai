Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given an array/list ‘ARR’ of ‘N’ positive integers and an integer ‘K’. Your task is to check if there exists a subset in ‘ARR’ with a sum equal to ‘K’.
Note: Return true if there exists a subset with sum equal to ‘K’. Otherwise, return false.
For Example :
If ‘ARR’ is {1,2,3,4} and ‘K’ = 4, then there exists 2 subsets with sum = 4. These are {1,3} and {4}. Hence, return true.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 10^3
0 <= ARR[i] <= 10^9
0 <= K <= 10^3

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
2
4 5
4 3 2 1
5 4
2 5 1 6 7

Sample Output 1:
true
false

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
In example 1, ‘ARR’ is {4,3,2,1} and ‘K’ = 5. There exist 2 subsets with sum = 5. These are {4,1} and {3,2}. Hence, return true.
In example 2, ‘ARR’ is {2,5,1,6,7} and ‘K’ = 4. There are no subsets with sum = 4. Hence, return false.

Sample Input 2:
2
4 4
6 1 2 1
5 6
1 7 2 9 10

Sample Output 2:
true
false

Explanation For Sample Input 2:
In example 1, ‘ARR’ is {6,1,2,1} and ‘K’ = 4. There exist 1 subset with sum = 4. That is {1,2,1}. Hence, return true.
In example 2, ‘ARR’ is {1,7,2,9,10} and ‘K’ = 6. There are no subsets with sum = 6. Hence, return false.
