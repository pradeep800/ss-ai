Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given an unweighted directed graph of 'V' vertices and 'E' edges. Your task is to print all the strongly connected components (SCCs) present in the graph.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )

Constraints:
1 <= 'T' <= 300 
1 <= 'V' <= 2000
'V' - 1 <= 'E' <= 2000
0 <= 'a, b' < 'V'

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
1
5 6
0 1
1 2
1 4
2 3
3 2
4 0

Sample Output 1:
0 1 4 
2 3 

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
For the first test case, the graph is shown below. There are two SCCs in the graph, which are enclosed in the boxes as shown in the image below.


Sample Input 2:
2
1 0
4 4
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 1

Sample Output 2:
0
0
1 2 3

Explanation For Sample Input 2:
For the first test case, the graph has 1 node(0) but there are no edges, therefore only 1 SCC exists and that is {0}.

For the second test case, one SCC is {0} and the other is {1, 2, 3}. Therefore the answer is 0, 1 2 3
