Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
There is a Binary Search Tree (BST) consisting of ‘N’ nodes. Each node of this BST has some integer data.




You are given the root node of this BST, and an integer ‘X’. Return true if there is a node in BST having data equal to ‘X’, otherwise return false.




A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure that has the following properties:
1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with data less than the node’s data.

2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with data greater than the node’s data.

3. The left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Note:
It is guaranteed that all nodes have distinct data.

Sample Input 1:
7 8
4 2 6 1 3 5 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 1:
False

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
There is no node having data 8. See the problem statement for the picture of this BST.

Sample Input 2:
4 1
3 1 5 -1 2 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 2:
True

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
There is a left node, and it has data 1. Thus, we should print ‘True’. 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10000
0 <= X <= 10^9
0 <= DATA <=10^9

Where ‘N’ is the number of nodes in the BST, ‘X’ is a given integer and ‘DATA’ is the data contained in each node of BST.
