You are given two strings 'S' and 'T' of lengths 'N' and 'M' respectively. Find the "Edit Distance" between the strings.
Edit Distance of two strings is the minimum number of steps required to make one string equal to the other. In order to do so, you can perform the following three operations:
1. Delete a character
2. Replace a character with another one
3. Insert a character

Note:
Strings don't contain spaces in between.

Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10 ^ 3
0 <= M <= 10 ^ 3

Time Limit : 1sec

Sample Input 1 :
abc
dc

Sample Output 1 :
2

Â Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
In 2 operations we can make the string T to look like string S. First, insert the character 'a' to string T, which makes it "adc".

And secondly, replace the character 'd' of the string T with 'b' from the string S. This would make string T to "abc" which is also the string S. Hence, the minimum distance.

Sample Input 2 :
whgtdwhgtdg
aswcfg

Sample Output 2 :
9
