You are given a binary tree having 'n' nodes. Each node of the tree has an integer value.




Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of a simple path between any two nodes (possibly the same) of the given tree.




A simple path is a path between any two nodes of a tree, such that no edge in the path is repeated twice. The sum of a simple path is defined as the summation of all node values in a path.

Sample Input 1:
1 2 3 4 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 1:
10

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
The tree looks as follows:
                        1
                       / \
                      2   3 
                     /
                    4
The path between Node 3 (with value 3) and Node 4 (with value 4) produces the maximum sum, i.e., 10. Hence, the maximum possible sum is 10 in this case.

Sample Input 2:
2 4 -1 3 6 -1 -1 -1 -1 

Sample Output 2:
13

Explanation For Sample Input 2:
The tree looks as follows:
                        2
                       / 
                      4    
                     / \   
                    3   6
The path between Node 3 (with value 3) and Node 4 (with value 6) produces the maximum sum, i.e., 13. Hence, the maximum possible sum is 13 in this case.

Expected Time Complexity:
 The expected time complexity is O(n).

Constraints:
1 <= 'n' <= 10^6
-10^5 <= 'data' <= 10^5 and 'data' !=-1

Where ‘n’ is the total number of nodes in the binary tree, and 'data' is the value of the binary tree node

Time Limit: 1 sec
