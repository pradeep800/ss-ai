Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given an unsorted array/list 'ARR' of 'N' integers. Your task is to return the length of the longest consecutive sequence.
The consecutive sequence is in the form ['NUM', 'NUM' + 1, 'NUM' + 2, ..., 'NUM' + L] where 'NUM' is the starting integer of the sequence and 'L' + 1 is the length of the sequence.
Note:
If there are any duplicates in the given array we will count only one of them in the consecutive sequence.

For Example-
For the given 'ARR' [9,5,4,9,10,10,6].

Output = 3
The longest consecutive sequence is [4,5,6].

Follow Up:
Can you solve this in O(N) time and O(N) space complexity?

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10^5
-10^9 <= ARR[i] <= 10^9

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1 :
1 
5
33 20 34 30 35

Sample Output 1 :
3

Explanation To Sample Input 1 :
The longest consecutive sequence is [33, 34, 35].

Sample Input 2 :
1
7
1 9 3 10 4 20 2    

Sample Output 2 :
4

Explanation To Sample Input 2 :
The consecutive sequence is in the form ['NUM', 'NUM' + 1, 'NUM' + 2,...,'NUM' + 'L']. So in the given array, the longest consecutive sequence is [1,2,3,4] where 'NUM' = 1 and 'L' = 3. And the length of the sequence will be 'L' + 1 = 4.
