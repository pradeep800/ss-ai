You have been given a Binary Tree of 'N' nodes, where the nodes have integer values. Your task is to return the size of the largest subtree of the binary tree which is also a BST.




A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure which has the following properties.
• The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with data less than the node’s data.
• The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with data greater than the node’s data.
• Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.





Example:
Given binary tree:


In the given binary tree, subtree rooted at 2 is a BST and its size is 3.

Sample Input 1 :
2 1 3 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 1:
3

Explanation for Sample 1:
In the given binary tree, subtree rooted at 2 is a BST and its size is 3.


Sample Input 2 :
50 -1 20 -1 30 -1 40 -1 50 -1 -1

Sample Output 2:
4

Constraints :
1 <= 'N' <= 10^5
0 <= 'data' <= 10^5     

where 'N' is the number of nodes and 'data' denotes the node value of the binary tree nodes.
