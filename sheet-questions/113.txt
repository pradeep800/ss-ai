Given a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of the values of the nodes of the given tree.
For each node at position (X, Y), (X-1, Y-1) will be its left child position while (X+1, Y-1) will be the right child position.
Running a vertical line from X = -infinity to X = +infinity, now whenever this vertical line touches some nodes, we need to add those values of the nodes in order starting from top to bottom with the decreasing ‘Y’ coordinates.
Note:
If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is added first will be the value that is on the left side.

For Example:
For the binary tree in the image below.


The vertical order traversal will be {2, 7, 5, 2, 6, 5, 11, 4, 9}.

Constraints:
1 <= 'T' <= 100
0 <= 'N' <= 3000
0 <= 'VAL' <= 10^5

Where 'VAL' is the value of any binary tree node.

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
2
1 2 3 4 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
1 -1 2 -1 -1

Sample Output 1:
4 2 1 3 
1 2 

Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
For the first test case, the vertical order traversal of the given binary tree will be {{4}, {2}, {1}, {3}}.

For the second test case, the vertical order traversal of the given binary tree will be {{1}, {2}}.

Sample Input 2:
2
2 1 -1 -1 -1
0 1 2 4 5 3 6 -1 -1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 2:
1 2
4 1 7 0 5 3 2 6 

Explanation Of Sample Input 2:
For the first test case, the vertical order traversal of the given binary tree will be {{1}, {2}}.

For the second test case, the vertical order traversal of the given binary tree will be {{4}, {1, 7}, {0, 5, 3}, {2}, {6}}.
