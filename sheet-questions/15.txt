You are given an array 'a' of 'n' integers.




A majority element in the array ‘a’ is an element that appears more than 'n' / 2 times.




Find the majority element of the array.




It is guaranteed that the array 'a' always has a majority element.




Example:
Input: ‘n’ = 9, ‘a’ = [2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: The frequency of ‘1’ is 5, which is greater than 9 / 2.
Hence ‘1’ is the majority element.
