You are given arrays 'inOrder' and 'postOrder', which represent 'inorder' traversal and 'postorder' traversal of a 'Binary Tree' respectively.




Construct a 'Binary Tree' represented by the given arrays and return it's head.




Note:
Assume that the Binary Tree contains only unique elements.





Example:
Input: 'inOrder' = [9, 3, 15, 20, 7], 'postOrder' = [9, 15, 7, 20, 3]

Output:
We get the following binary tree from Inorder and Postorder traversal:

Sample Input 1:
7
4 5 2 6 7 3 1
4 2 5 1 6 3 7





Output On Console:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7





Explanation for Sample Output 1:
We get the following Binary Tree from the given Inorder and Postorder traversal:





Sample Input 2:
6
2 9 3 6 10 5
2 6 3 9 5 10





Sample Output 2:
5 6 10 2 3 9





Explanation for Sample Output 2:
We get the following Binary Tree from the given Inorder and Postorder traversal:





Expected Time Complexity:
Try to solve this in O(n).





Constraints :
1 <= 'n' <= 10000
1 <=  'inOrder[i]' , ‘postOrder[i]’ <= 100000  

Time Limit: 1 second
