Suggest Edit
You are given an array of integers 'prices' of size 'n', where ‘prices[i]’ is the price of a given stock on an ‘i’-th day.




You want to maximize the profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and a different day to sell that stock.




Please note that you can’t sell a stock before you buy one.




Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.




Example :
Input: ‘prices’ =[7, 1, 5, 4, 3, 6]

Output: 5

Explanation: Purchase stock on day two, where the price is one, and sell it on day six, where the price is 6, profit = 6 - 1 = 5.

Hence we return 5.
