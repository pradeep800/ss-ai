Given a binary tree with N number of nodes, check if that input tree is Partial BST (Binary Search Tree) or not. If yes, return true, return false otherwise.
A binary search tree (BST) is said to be a Partial BST if it follows the following properties.
• The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with data less than and equal to the node’s data.
• The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with data greater than and equal to the node’s data.
• Both the left and right subtrees must also be partial binary search trees.

Example:
Input:

Answer:
Level 1: 

All the nodes in the left subtree of 4 (2, 1, 3) are smaller 
than 4, all the nodes in the right subtree of the 4 (5) are 
larger than 4.

Level 2 :

For node 2:
All the nodes in the left subtree of 2 (1) are smaller than 
2, all the nodes in the right subtree of the 2 (3) are larger than 2.
For node 5:
The left and right subtree for node 5 is empty.

Level 3:

For node 1:
The left and right subtree for node 1 are empty.
For node 3:
The left and right subtree for node 3 are empty.
Because all the nodes follow the property of a Partial binary 
search tree, the above tree is a Partial binary search tree.

Sample Input 1:
2
3 1 5 -1 2 -1 -1 -1 -1
3 2 5 1 4 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 1:
 true
 false

Explanation Of The Sample Input1:
Here we have 2 test cases, hence there are 2 binary trees

Test Case 1: 


 Level 1: 
For node 3 all the nodes in the left subtree (1,2) are 
less than 3 and all the nodes in the right subtree (5) 
are greater than 3. 

Level 2:
For node 1:
The left subtree is empty and all the nodes in the right 
subtree (2) are greater than 1.  
For node 5:
Both right and left subtrees are empty.

Level 3:
For node 2, both right and left subtrees are empty.
Because all the nodes follow the property of a Partial binary 
search tree, the function should return true.

Test Case 2: 


For the root node, all the nodes in the right subtree (5) are greater than 3. But node with data 4 in the left subtree of node 3 is greater than 3, this does not satisfy the condition for the Partial binary search tree. Hence, the function should return false.
