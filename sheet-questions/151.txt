Ninja has found his new passion for photography. He has clicked some really good photos but in one of his images, he doesnâ€™t like the color of a particular region. So, he decides to change the color of that region. Can you help him with this task?
The image is represented in the form of a 2D array of size M * N. Each pixel in the image is a positive integer. Ninja has given you the coordinates (row and column) of a certain pixel and the new color value. You need to replace the color of the given pixel and all adjacent same-colored pixels with the new color.
Note:
Two pixels are adjacent if they are connected to each other in any of the four directions: up, down, left, or right.

Diagonal pixels are not considered adjacent.

Example:
Consider the image of size 4*4, shown below (left). Let the coordinates of the starting pixel are (1, 2) and the new color is 8. The starting pixel, highlighted with red color, has a pixel value of 3. 

On replacing the given pixel and all adjacent same-colored pixels with the new color we get the new image, shown below (right). The modified pixels are highlighted with green color.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100 
1 <= M, N <= 50
0 <= X < M
0 <= Y < N
1 <= Image[i][j], C <= 10^5    

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
For the first test case, refer to the example explained before.

For the second test case, we are given an image of size 5*6, shown below (left). The coordinates of the starting pixel are (3, 2) and the new color is 4. The starting pixel, highlighted with red color, has a pixel value of 2. 

On replacing the given pixel and all adjacent same colored pixels with the new color we get the new image, shown below (right). The modified pixels are highlighted with green color.


Sample Input 2:
