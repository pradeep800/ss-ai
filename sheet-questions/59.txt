You are given a N*N maze with a rat placed at 'mat[0][0]'. Find all paths that rat can follow to reach its destination i.e. mat[N-1][N-1]. The directions in which the rat can move are 'U'(up), 'D'(down), 'L' (left), 'R' (right).




In the given maze, each cell can have a value of either 0 or 1. Cells with a value of 0 are considered blocked, which means the rat cannot enter or traverse through them. On the other hand, cells with a value of 1 are open, indicating that the rat is allowed to enter and move through those cells.




Example:
mat:{{1, 0, 0, 0},
     {1, 1, 0, 1}, 
     {1, 1, 0, 0},
     {0, 1, 1, 1}}

All possible paths are:
DDRDRR (in red)
DRDDRR (in green)
