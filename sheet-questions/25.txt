Given a singly linked list of integers. Your task is to return the head of the reversed linked list.
For Example:
The given linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4-> NULL. Then the reverse linked list is 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL and the head of the reversed linked list will be 4.

Follow Up :
Can you solve this problem in O(N) time and O(1) space complexity?
