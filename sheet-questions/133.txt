You have been given a sorted array of length ‘N’. You need to construct a balanced binary search tree from the array. If there can be more than one possible tree, then you can return any.
Note:
1. A balanced binary tree is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

2. A binary search tree is a binary tree data structure, with the following properties
    a. The left subtree of any node contains nodes with value less than the node’s value.
    b. The right subtree of any node contains nodes with values equal to or greater than the node’s value.
    c. Right, and left subtrees are also binary search trees.

Example:
Below tree, is a balanced binary search tree


Below tree is not a balanced tree as the height of the left subtree and right subtree of node ‘5’ differs by more than 1. Moreover, the tree is also not a BST as node ‘2’ is less than node ‘3’ but ‘2’ is the right child of ‘3’.

Sample Input 1:
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
1
12 

Sample Output 1:
1
1

Explanation of Sample Input 1:
For the first test case, one of the possible balanced BST will look like.


Level order traversal of the above tree is [ 3, 2, 5, 1, -1, 4 ], if you return this tree then you will get the output as 1.

For the second test case, the tree has only one node that is ‘12’.
Level order traversal is [ 12 ], if you return this tree then you will get the output as 1.

Sample Input 2:
1
2
5 17

Sample Output 2:
1

Explanation of Sample Input 2:
The tree will look like this.


Another possible tree is


Level order traversal is [ 17, 5 ] and [ 5, -1, 17 ], if you return any of this tree you will get the output as 1.
