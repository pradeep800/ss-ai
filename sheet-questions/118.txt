You are given a Binary Tree.




Return the length of the diameter of the tree.




Note :
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two end nodes in a tree.

The number of edges between two nodes represents the length of the path between them.

Example :
Input: Consider the given binary tree:


Output: 6

Explanation:
Nodes in the diameter are highlighted. The length of the diameter, i.e., the path length, is 6.

Sample Input 1 :
1 2 3 4 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1





Sample Output 1 :
3





Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :
The binary tree in the given test case will look like


The length of the diameter of the above tree is the length of the path between nodes 4 and 3, i.e., 4->2->1->3. Hence the output will be 3.





Sample Input 2 :
1 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1





Sample Output 2 :
2





Explanation Of Sample Input 2 :
The binary tree in the given test case will look like


The length of the diameter of the above tree is the length of the path between nodes 2 and 3, i.e., 2.





Expected Time Complexity:
Try to do this in O(n).





Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10000

Where 'n' is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

Time Limit: 1 sec
