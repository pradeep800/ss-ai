You are given an integer 'N'. For a given 'N' x 'N' chessboard, find a way to place 'N' queens such that no queen can attack any other queen on the chessboard.
A queen can be killed when it lies in the same row, or same column, or the same diagonal of any of the other queens. You have to print all such configurations.

Constraints:
1 <= 'N' <= 10

Time Limit: 1sec

Sample Input 1:
4

Sample Output 1:
0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
Output depicts two possible configurations of the chessboard for 4 queens.

The Chessboard matrix for the first configuration looks as follows:-

0 0 1 0
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0

Queen contained cell is depicted by 1. As seen, No queen is in the same row, column, or diagonal as the other queens. Hence this is a valid configuration.
