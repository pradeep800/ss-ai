Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given an array 'nums' of ‘n’ integers.




Return all subset sums of 'nums' in a non-decreasing order.




Note:
Here subset sum means sum of all elements of a subset of 'nums'. A subset of 'nums' is an array formed by removing some (possibly zero or all) elements of 'nums'.





For Example
Input: 'nums' = [1,2]

Output: 0 1 2 3

Explanation:
Following are the subset sums:
0 (by considering empty subset)
1 
2
1+2 = 3
So, subset sum are [0,1,2,3].

Sample Input 1 :
3
1 2 3

Sample Output 1 :
0 1 2 3 3 4 5 6

Explanation For Sample Output 1:
For the first test case,
Following are the subset sums:
0 (by considering empty subset)
1
2
1+2 = 3
3
1+3 = 4
2+3 = 5
1+2+3 = 6
So, subset-sums are [0,1,2,3,3,4,5,6]

Sample Input 2 :
2 
4 5

Sample Output 2 :
0 4 5 9

Expected Time Complexity:
Try to do this in O(n*2^n). 

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 15
0 <= nums[i] <= 5000

Time limit: 1 sec
