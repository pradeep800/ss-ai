You are given an array 'ARR' of integers of length 'N' and a positive integer 'K'. You need to find the maximum elements for each and every contiguous subarray of size K of the array.
For Example
'ARR' =  [3, 4, -1, 1, 5] and 'K' = 3
Output =  [4, 4, 5]

Since the maximum element of the first subarray of length three ([3, 4, -1]) is 4, the maximum element of the second subarray of length three ([4, -1, 1]) is also 4 and the maximum element of the last subarray of length three ([-1, 1, 5]) is 5, so you need to return [4, 4, 5].

Sample Input 1 :
1
5 3
3 2 -6 1 0

Sample Output 1:
3 2 1

Explanation For Input 1:
The subarray of length 'K'      maximum element of the subarray.
3 2 -6                                    3
2 -6 1                                    2
-6 1 0                                    1

Thus, you need to return "3 2 1".

Sample Input 2 :
1
9 3
1 2 3 1 4 5 2 3 6

Sample Output 2:
3 3 4 5 5 5 6
