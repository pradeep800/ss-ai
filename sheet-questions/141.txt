You are given a binary search tree of integers with 'N' nodes. Your task is to return the K-th largest element of this BST.
If there is no K-th largest element in the BST, return -1.
A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure which has the following properties.
• The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with data less than the node’s data.
• The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with data greater than the node’s data.
• Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
