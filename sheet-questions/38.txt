Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given a linked list containing 'n' nodes, where every node in the linked list contains two pointers:




(1) ‘next’ which points to the next node in the list
(2) ‘random’ which points to a random node in the list or 'null'.




Your task is to create a 'deep copy' of the given linked list and return its head.




Note:
A 'deep copy' of a linked list means we do not copy the references of the nodes of the original linked list, rather for each node in the original linked list, a new node is created.
