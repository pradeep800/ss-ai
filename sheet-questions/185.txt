Implement Trie Data Structure to support these operations:
insert(word) - To insert a string "word" in Trie
search(word) - To check if string "word" is present in Trie or not.
startsWith(word) - To check if there is any string in the Trie that starts with the given prefix string "word".





Three type of queries denote these operations:
Type 1: To insert a string "word" in Trie.
1 word

Type 2: To check if the string "word" is present in Trie or not.
2 word

Type 3: To check if there is any string in the Trie that starts with the given prefix string "word".
3 word

Constraints :
1 <= Q <= 5*10^4
1 <= W <= 10

Where 'Q' is the number of queries, and 'W' is the length of the "word".
All input of "word" will consist of only lowercase letters a-z.

Sample Input 1 :
5
1 hello
1 help
2 help
3 hel
2 hel

true
true
false

 Explanation To Sample Input 1 :

Query 4: "true" is printed as "hello" and "help" is present having the prefix "hel"
Query 5: "false" is printed as "hel" is not present
