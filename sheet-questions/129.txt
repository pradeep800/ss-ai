You are provided with a Binary Tree and one of its leaf nodes. You have to invert this binary tree. Inversion must be done by following all the below guidelines:
• The given leaf node becomes the root after the inversion.

• For a node (say, ‘x’) 
    ○ If there exists the left child that is not yet taken then this child must become the right child of ‘x’.
    ○ If the left child is already taken then the right child is still on the right side of ‘x’.

• The parent of ‘x’ must be the left child of ‘x’.

For Example:




Consider the above binary tree (image- before inversion), if the given leaf node is ‘1’ then the binary tree after inversion becomes exactly the same as given in the image representing after inversion.

Note:
The given binary tree will only have distinct values of nodes.

Time limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
1
1
5 6 15 4 1 -5 2 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 1:
1 6 -1 5 4 -1 15 -1 -1 -5 2 -1 -1 -1 -1

Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
For the first test case, the explanation is provided in the description.

Sample Input 2:
2
2
1 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1
3
1 2 -1 3 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 2:
2 1 -1 -1 3 -1 -1
3 2 -1 1 -1 -1 -1

Explanation For Sample Input 2:
In the first test case, the inverted tree will look like this:


In the second test case, the inverted tree will look like this:
