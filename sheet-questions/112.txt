You have been given a Binary Tree of 'N'

nodes, where the nodes have integer values.




Your task is to return the ln-Order, Pre-Order, and Post-Order traversals of the given binary tree.




For Example :
For the given binary tree:


The Inorder traversal will be [5, 3, 2, 1, 7, 4, 6].
The Preorder traversal will be [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 7, 6].
The Postorder traversal will be [5, 2, 3, 7, 6, 4, 1].

Sample Input 1 :
1 2 3 -1 -1 -1  6 -1 -1

Sample Output 1 :
2 1 3 6 
1 2 3 6 
2 6 3 1

Explanation Of Sample Output 1 :
 The given binary tree is shown below:


Inorder traversal of given tree = [2, 1, 3, 6]
Preorder traversal of given tree = [1, 2, 3, 6]
Postorder traversal of given tree = [2, 6, 3, 1]

Sample Input 2 :
1 2 4 5 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 2 :
5 2 3 1 4 
1 2 5 3 4 
5 3 2 4 1

Explanation Of Sample Output 2 :
The given binary tree is shown below:


Inorder traversal of given tree = [5, 2, 3, 1, 4]
Preorder traversal of given tree = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4]
Postorder traversal of given tree = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1]

Constraints :
1 <= 'N' <= 10^5
0 <= 'data' <= 10^5     

where 'N' is the number of nodes and 'data' denotes the node value of the binary tree nodes.
