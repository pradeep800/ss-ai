You are given a matrix 'MATRIX' of dimension 'N' x 'M'. Your task is to make all the elements of row 'i' and column 'j' equal to 0 if any element in the ith row or jth column of the matrix is 0.

Note:
1) The number of rows should be at least 1.

2) The number of columns should be at least 1.

3) For example, refer to the below matrix illustration:

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= M <= 100
-10^9 <= MATRIX[i][j] <= 10^9

Where 'MATRIX[i][j]' denotes the matrix element.

Follow Up:
Can you solve it with the space complexity of O(1)?
