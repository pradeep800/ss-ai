You are given an array ‘arr’ of ‘n’ positive integers.




You are also given a positive integer ‘target’.




Your task is to find all unique combinations of elements of array ‘arr’ whose sum is equal to ‘target’. Each number in ‘arr’ may only be used once in the combination.




Elements in each combination must be in non-decreasing order and you need to print all unique combinations in lexicographical order.




Note:
In lexicographical order, combination/array  ‘a’  comes before array ‘b’ if at the first index 'i' where 'a[i]' differs from 'b[i]', 'a[i]' < 'b[i]  or length of 'a' is less than 'b'.





Example:
Input: ‘arr’ = [1, 2, 3, 1], ‘target’ = 5. 

Output: [[1,1,3], [2,3]]

Explanation:
All possible valid combinations with sum = 5 in lexicographical order are -:
(1, 1, 3)
(2, 3)

Sample Input 1:
7 8
10 1 2 7 6 1 5





Sample Output 1:
1 1 6
1 2 5
1 7
2 6





Explanation For Sample Input 1:
Here ‘n’ = 7, 'arr' = [10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1 , 5], and ‘target’ = 8
All unique combinations whose sum of elements is 8 are -:     

(1, 1, 6)  because, 1 + 1 + 6 = 8
(1, 2, 5)  because,  1 + 2 + 5 = 8
(1, 7)  because, 1 + 7 = 8                                                                                                               
(2, 6)  because,  2 + 6 = 8

Note that, elements in each combination are in non-decreasing order and all unique combinations are arranged in lexicographical order. 





Sample Input 2:
5 5
1 2 3 1 5





Sample Output 2:
1 1 3
2 3
5





Expected Time Complexity:
Try to do this in O(2^n).





Constraints:
1 <= n <= 20
1 <= arr[i] <= 30
1 <= target <= 500

Time Limit: 1 sec
