Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given a 'Nx3' 2-D array 'Jobs' describing 'N' jobs where 'Jobs[i][0]' denotes the id of 'i-th' job, 'Jobs[i][1]' denotes the deadline of 'i-th' job, and 'Jobs[i][2]' denotes the profit associated with 'i-th job'.




You will make a particular profit if you complete the job within the deadline associated with it. Each job takes 1 unit of time to be completed, and you can schedule only one job at a particular time.




Return the number of jobs to be done to get maximum profit.




Note :
If a particular job has a deadline 'x', it means that it needs to be completed at any time before 'x'.

Assume that the start time is 0.





For Example :
'N' = 3, Jobs = [[1, 1, 30], [2, 3, 40], [3, 2, 10]].

All the jobs have different deadlines. So we can complete all the jobs.

At time 0-1, Job 1 will complete.
At time 1-2, Job 3 will complete.
At time 2-3, Job 2 will complete.

So our answer is [3 80].

Sample Input 1 :
4
1 2 30
2 2 40
3 1 10
4 1 10

Sample Output 1 :
2 70

Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
At time 0-1, Job 1 will complete.

At time 1-2, Job 2 will complete.

The first and second jobs can be completed within the deadlines, and we earn a profit of 70 by doing so.

Sample Input 2 :
3
1 1 40
2 1 50
3 1 60

Sample Output 2 :
1 60

Constraints :
1 <= 'N' <= 10^5
1 <= jobs[i][0] <= 'N'
1 <= jobs[i][1] <= 'N'
1 <= jobs[i][2] <= 10^3

Time limit: 1 sec
