The height of a tree is equal to the number of nodes on the longest path from the root to a leaf.




You are given an arbitrary binary tree consisting of 'n' nodes where each node is associated with a certain value.




Find out the height of the tree.




Example :
Input: Let the binary tree be:


Output: 2

Explanation: The root node is 3, and the leaf nodes are 1 and 2.

There are two nodes visited when traversing from 3 to 1.
There are two nodes visited when traversing from 3 to 2.

Therefore the height of the binary tree is 2.

Sample Input 1:
3 1 2 -1 -1 -1 -1





Sample Output 1:
2





Explanation For Sample Input 1:
The given tree is:


The root node is 3, and the leaf nodes are 1 and 2.

There are two nodes visited when traversing from 3 to 1.
There are two nodes visited when traversing from 3 to 2.

Therefore the height of the binary tree is 2.





Sample Input 2:
3 -1 1 2 -1 -1 -1





Sample Output 2:
3





Explanation Of Sample Input 2 :
The given tree is:


The root node is 3, and there is only one leaf node, which is 2.

All three nodes are visited while traversing from 3 to 2.

Therefore the height of the binary tree is 3.





Sample Input 3:
2 -1 -1





Sample Output 3:
1





Expected Time Complexity :
The expected time complexity is O(n).





Constraints :
1 <= 'n' <= 10000

Time Limit: 1 second
