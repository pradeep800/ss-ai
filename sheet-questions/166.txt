You have been given a directed weighted graph of ‘N’ vertices labeled from 1 to 'N' and ‘M’ edges. Each edge connecting two nodes 'u' and 'v' has a weight 'w' denoting the distance between them.




Your task is to calculate the shortest distance of all vertices from the source vertex 'src'.




Note:
If there is no path between 'src' and 'ith' vertex, the value at 'ith' index in the answer array will be 10^8.

Example :

3 3 1
1 2 2
1 3 2
2 3 -1

In the above graph: 

The length of the shortest path between vertex 1 and vertex 1 is 1->1 and the cost is 0.

The length of the shortest path between vertex 1 and vertex 2 is 1->2 and the cost is 2.

The length of the shortest path between vertex 1 and vertex 3 is 1->2->3 and the cost is 1.

Hence we return [0, 2, 1].

Note :
It's guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain self-loops and multiple edges. Also, the graph does not contain negative weight cycles.

Sample Input 1 :
4 4 1
1 2 4
1 3 3
2 4 7 
3 4 -2

Sample Output 1 :
0 4 3 1

Explanation For Sample Output 1 :

In the above graph: 

The length of the shortest path between vertex 1 and vertex 1 is 1->1 and the cost is 0.

The length of the shortest path between vertex 1 and vertex 2 is 1->2 and the cost is 4.

The length of the shortest path between vertex 1 and vertex 3 is 1->3 and the cost is 3.

The length of the shortest path between vertex 1 and vertex 4 is 1->3->4 and the cost is 1.

Hence we return [0, 4, 3, 1].

Sample Input 2 :
2 1 1
2 1 3

Sample Output 2 :
0 1000000000

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 50
1 <= M <= 300
1 <= src <= N
1 <= u,v <= N
-10^5 <= w <= 10^5
