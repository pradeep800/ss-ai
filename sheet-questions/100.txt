Given a string STR of length N. The task is to return the count of minimum characters to be added at front to make the string a palindrome.
For example, for the given string “deed”, the string is already a palindrome, thus, minimum characters needed are 0.
Similarly, for the given string “aabaaca”, the minimum characters needed are 2 i.e. ‘a’ and ‘c’ which makes the string “acaabaaca” palindrome.
