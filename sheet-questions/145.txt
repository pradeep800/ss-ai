Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You have been given a binary tree of integers. You are supposed to serialize and deserialize (refer to notes) the given binary tree.




You can choose any algorithm to serialize/deserialize the given binary tree. You only have to ensure that the serialized string can be deserialized to the original binary tree.




Note :
Serialization is the process of translating a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored or transmitted (for example, across a computer network) and reconstructed later. The opposite operation, that is, extracting a data structure from stored information, is deserialization.

Sample Input 1 :
1 -1 3 -1 -1

Sample Output 1 :
1 -1 3 -1 -1 

Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
The given tree looks as follows:
               1
                \
                 3
The level order traversal of the given tree will be “1 -1 3 -1 -1” where -1 denotes the null nodes.

Sample Input 2 :
1 2 3 -1 4 5 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 2 :
1 2 3 -1 4 5 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Explanation For Sample Input 2:
The given tree looks as follows:
                1
               / \
              2   3
              \   / 
               4 5

The level order traversal of the given tree will be “1 2 3 -1 4 5 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1" where -1 denotes the null nodes.

Expected Time Complexity:
The expected time complexity is O(n).

Constraints :
0 <= 'n' <= 10^6
1 <= 'data' <= 10^8 and data != -1,
 Where 'n' is the number of nodes and 'data' is the value at the nodes.

Time Limit: 1 sec
