Return true if all non-leaf nodes in a given binary tree have a value that is equal to the sum of their child nodes, otherwise return false..




For Example:

Output: true 
Explanation: Node 2 and 3 are children of Node 1 and (3+1)=4.

Sample Input 1:
4
5 3 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 1:
true

Explanation Of Sample Input 1:

Node 1: The sum of its child nodes is 3 + 2 = 5, which is equal to its value.
Node 2: The sum of its child nodes is 3, which is equal to its value.
Node 3: It is a leaf node with no child nodes, so the condition is satisfied.
Node 4: It is a leaf node with no child nodes, so the condition is satisfied.

Sample Input 2:
6
7 3 4 3 -1 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 2:
false

Explanation Of Sample Input 2:

Node 1: The sum of its child nodes is 3 + 4 = 7, which is equal to its value.
Node 2: The sum of its child nodes is 3, which is equal to its value.
Node 3: The sum of its child nodes is 2 + 3 = 5, which is not equal to its value 4, so the condition is not satisfied. Hence the answer is false.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= data <= 10^5
