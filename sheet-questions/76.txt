Queue is a linear data structure that follows the idea of First In First Out. That means insertion and retrieval operations happen at opposite ends.




Implement a simple queue using arrays.




You are given 'query' queries which are either of the 2 types:




1 'e': Enqueue (add) element ‘e’ at the end of the queue.
2: Dequeue (retrieve) the element from the front of the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.




Example:
Input: Queries: 
             [ 1 2,
               1 7,
               2,
               1 13, 
               2, 
               2, 
               2 ]

Output:
         [ 2, 
           7, 
           13,  
           -1 ]

Explanation: After each operation, our queue is equal to the following:
1 2: {2}
1 7: {2, 7}
2: {7} and 2 is printed
1 13: {7, 13}
2: {13} and 7 is printed
2: {} and 13 is printed
2: {} and -1 is printed since the queue is empty.

Sample Input 1:
7
1 2
1 7
2
1 13
2
2
2





Sample Output 1:
2 7 13 -1





Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :
After each operation, our queue is equal to the following:
1 2: {2}
1 7: {2, 7}
2: {7} and 2 is printed
1 13: {7, 13}
2: {13} and 7 is printed
2: {} and 13 is printed
2: {} and -1 is printed since the queue is empty.





Sample Input 2 :
4
2
2
1 2
1 4





Sample Output 2 :
-1 -1





Explanation Of Sample Input 2 :
After each operation, our queue is equal to the following:
2: {} and -1 is printed since the queue is empty.
2: {} and -1 is printed since the queue is empty.
1 2: {2}
1 4: {2, 4}





Expected Time Complexity :
Both the enqueue() and dequeue() functions should solve in constant time, that is O(1) time complexity.





Constraints:
1 <= ‘query’ <= 10^5
1 <= ‘e’ <= 10^6
