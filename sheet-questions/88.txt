You have been given a grid containing some oranges. Each cell of this grid has one of the three integers values:
Value 0 - representing an empty cell.
Value 1 - representing a fresh orange.
Value 2 - representing a rotten orange.
Every second, any fresh orange that is adjacent(4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
Your task is to find out the minimum time after which no cell has a fresh orange. If it's impossible to rot all the fresh oranges then print -1.
Note:
1. The grid has 0-based indexing.
2. A rotten orange can affect the adjacent oranges 4 directionally i.e. Up, Down, Left, Right.
