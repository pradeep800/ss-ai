Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given an arbitrary binary tree consisting of 'N' nodes numbered from 1 to 'N'. Your task is to print all the root to leaf paths of the binary tree.
A leaf of a binary tree is the node which does not have a left child and a right child.




For Example :
Given a binary tree :


All the root to leaf paths are :
1 2 4
1 2 5 
1 3

Note :
1. Two nodes may have the same value associated with it.
2. The root node will be fixed and will be provided in the function.
3. Note that the nodes in a path will appear in a fixed order. For example, 1 2 3 is not the same as 2 1 3.
4. Each path should be returned as a string consisting of nodes in order and separated by a space.
5. The path length may be as small as ‘1’.
