Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You have been given a Binary Tree of distinct integers and two nodes ‘X’ and ‘Y’. You are supposed to return the LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) of ‘X’ and ‘Y’.




The LCA of ‘X’ and ‘Y’ in the binary tree is the shared ancestor of ‘X’ and ‘Y’ that is located farthest from the root.




Note :
You may assume that given ‘X’ and ‘Y’ definitely exist in the given binary tree.

For Example :
For the given binary tree


LCA of ‘X’ and ‘Y’ is highlighted in yellow colour.
