Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You have been given the preorder and inorder traversal of a binary tree. Your task is to construct a binary tree using the given inorder and preorder traversals.




Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the given traversals.

For Example :
For the preorder sequence = [1, 2, 4, 7, 3] and the inorder sequence = [4, 2, 7, 1, 3], we get the following binary tree.

Sample Input 1:
5
1 2 4 7 3
4 2 7 1 3

Sample Output 1:
1 2 3 4 7

1 2 3

Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
The tree after the construction is shown below.


Sample Input 2:
2
1 2
2 1

Sample Output 2:
1 2

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 3000
1 <= data <= 10^4

Where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the binary tree, and “data” is the value of the binary tree node.


Time Limit: 1sec

Follow-Up:
Can you solve this in O(N) time complexity?
