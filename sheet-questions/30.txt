You are given a Singly Linked List of integers and a reference to the node to be deleted. Every node of the Linked List has a unique value written on it. Your task is to delete that node from the linked list.
A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which we can traverse only in one direction i.e. from Head to Tail. It consists of several nodes where each node contains some data and a reference to the next node.
Note:
• The reference to the head of the linked list is not given.
• The node to be deleted is not a tail node.
• The value of each node in the Linked List is unique.
• It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is present in the linked list.

A sample Linked List-

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
2 <= N <= 5000
-10 ^ 9 <= NODE.DATA <= 10 ^ 9 and node.data != -1

Where 'N' denotes the total number of nodes in the Linked List and 'NODE.DATA' is the value of the node present.

Time limit: 1 sec.

Sample Input 1:
2
2 5 7 10 -1
7
-8 3 4 -2 1 -1
4

Sample Output 1:
2 5 10 -1
-8 3 -2 1 -1

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
For the first test case, the given Linked List is


So, after deleting the node 7, the Linked List becomes 2 → 5 → 10 → NULL, which is shown in the below figure.


For the second test case, the given Linked List is


So, after deleting the node 4, the Linked List becomes  -8 → 3 → -2 → 1 → NULL.

Sample Input 2:
2
4 9 10 -1
4
-7 7 -1
-7

Sample Output 2:
9 10 -1
7 -1

Explanation For Sample Input 2:
For the first test case, the given Linked List is


So, after deleting the node 4, the Linked List becomes 9 → 10 → NULL.


For the second test case, the given Linked List is


So, after deleting the node -7, the Linked List becomes 7 → NULL.
