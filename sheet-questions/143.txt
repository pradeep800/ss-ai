Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given a class named as BSTIterator that represents an iterator over inorder traversal of a binary search tree. You need to implement the following things as follows:
1. BSTIterator(Node root) - It is a parameterized constructor in which you are given the root of the Binary search tree. It will be called whenever an object of BSTIterator is created.

2. next() - This member function will return the next smallest element in the in-order traversal of the binary search tree. You need to implement this function.

3. hasNext() - This function will return true if there exists the next smallest element in the traversal else it will return false. You need to implement this function

The binary search tree has ‘N’ nodes you need to print the inorder traversal of the tree using the iterator.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10^4  
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9 

Where ‘T’ is the number of test cases, ‘N’ is the number of nodes, and A[i] is the value of a node.

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
2
2 1 3 -1 -1 -1 -1
10 5 -1 2 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 1:
1 2 3
2 5 10

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
Test case 1:
The tree will look like this :


The inorder traversal of the tree will be 1, 2, 3.

Test case 2:
The tree will look like this:


The inorder traversal of the tree will be 2, 5, 10.

Sample Input 2:
2
6 -1 7 -1 8 -1 -1    
3 2 4 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 2:
6 7 8
1 2 3 4
