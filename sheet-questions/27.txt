Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given two sorted linked lists. You have to merge them to produce a combined sorted linked list. You need to return the head of the final linked list.
Note:
The given linked lists may or may not be null.

For example:
If the first list is: 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL and the second list is: 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> NULL

The final list would be: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 5 -> NULL

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= L <= 10^5
1 ≤ data ≤ 10^6 and data != -1

Where L is the number of nodes in either of the two Linked List.

Time Limit: 1 sec 

Follow-up:
Try to solve this problem in linear time complexity and constant space complexity.

Sample Input 1:
2
1 4 5 -1
2 3 5 -1
7 8 -1
1 3 4 6 -1

Sample Output 1:
1 2 3 4 5 5 -1
1 3 4 6 7 8 -1

Explanation Of Input 1:
The first test case is already explained in the problem statement.

The second test case, the first list is: 7 -> 8 -> NULL
The second list is: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> NULL
The final list would be: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> NULL

Sample Input 2:
2
5 -1
1 3 6 10 -1
1 1 1 -1
1 1 1 -1

Sample Output 2
1 3 5 6 10 -1
1 1 1 1 1 1 -1
