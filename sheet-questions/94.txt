You are given a string 's' that represents a Roman number. Convert the Roman number to an integer and return it.




Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.




Table Of Values:
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For Example:
3 is written as III in Roman numeral, just three ones added together. 13 is written as XIII, which is simply X + III. The number 25 is written as XXV, which is XX + V
