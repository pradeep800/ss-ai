Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given a Singly Linked List of integers. Return true if it has a cycle, else return false.




A cycle occurs when a node's next points back to a previous node in the list.




Example:
In the given linked list, there is a cycle, hence we return true.

Sample Input 1 :
1 2 3 4 -1
1





Sample Output 1 :
true





Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
The linked list given in the input is as follows:





Sample Input 2 :
1 2 3 4 -1
0





Sample Output 2 :
true





Explanation Of Sample Input 2:
The linked list given in the input is as follows:





Sample Input 3 :
5 -1
-1





Sample Output 3 :
false





Explanation Of Sample Input 3:
 The linked list given in the input is as follows:





Expected Time Complexity:
Try to solve this problem in O(n).





Expected Space Complexity:
Try to solve this problem in O(1).





Constraints :
0 <= n <= 10^6
-1 <= pos < n
-10^9 <= data <= 10^9 and data != -1

Where 'n' is the size of the singly linked list, 'pos' represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where the tail connects to, and 'data' is the Integer data of the singly linked list.

Time Limit: 1 sec
