Aahad and Harshit always have fun by solving problems. Harshit took a sorted array consisting of distinct integers and rotated it clockwise by an unknown amount. For example, he took a sorted array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and if he rotates it by 2, then the array becomes: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].
After rotating a sorted array, Aahad needs to answer Q queries asked by Harshit, each of them is described by one integer Q[i]. which Harshit wanted him to search in the array. For each query, if he found it, he had to shout the index of the number, otherwise, he had to shout -1.
For each query, you have to complete the given method where 'key' denotes Q[i]. If the key exists in the array, return the index of the 'key', otherwise, return -1.
Note:
Can you solve each query in O(logN) ?

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9
1 <= Q <= 10^5
-10^9 <= Q[i] <= 10^9

Time Limit: 1sec

Sample Input 1:
4
2 5 -3 0
2
5
1

Sample Output 1:
1
-1

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
In the 1st test case, 5 is found at index 1

In the 2nd test case, 1 is not found in the array, hence return -1.

Sample Input 2:
5
100 -2 6 10 11
2
100
6

Sample Output 2:
0
2
