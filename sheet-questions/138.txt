You are given a BST (Binary search tree) with’ N’ number of nodes and a value ‘X’. Your task is to find the greatest value node of the BST which is smaller than or equal to ‘X’.
Note :‘X’ is not smaller than the smallest node of BST .
For example:

In the above example, For the given BST  and X = 7, the greatest value node of the BST  which is smaller than or equal to  7 is 6.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 5 * 10 ^ 3
1 <= nodeVal[i] <= 10 ^ 9

Time Limit: 1 sec.

Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
In the first test case, the BST looks like as below:


The greatest value node of the BST which is smaller than or equal to  7 is 6.

In the second test case, the BST looks like as below:


The greatest value node of the BST which is smaller than or equal to  2 is 2.

Sample Input 2:
2
5 3 10 2 4 6 15 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
