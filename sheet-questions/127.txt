You have been given a Binary Tree having 'n' nodes.




A Symmetric tree is a binary tree whose mirror image is the same as the original tree.




Find out whether the given tree is symmetric or not.




Example :
Input: Let the binary tree be:


Output: YES

Explanation: As we can see in the image, the original tree is the same as the mirrored tree.

Sample Input 1:
1 2 2 3 4 4 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1





Sample Output 1:
YES





Explanation For Sample 1:
As we can see in the image, the original tree is the same as the mirrored tree.





Sample Input 2:
1 2 3 4 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1





Sample Output 2:
NO

Explanation For Sample Input 2:
As we can see in the image, the original tree is not the same as the mirrored tree.





Expected Time Complexity :
The expected time complexity is O(n).





Constraints:
0 <= 'n' <= 10000
1 <= Node data <= 10 ^ 6

Time Limit: 1 second
