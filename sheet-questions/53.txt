Given a string 's', partition s such that every partition string is a palindrome.




Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.




Note:
You don’t need to print anything. Just implement the given function.

Example:
Input: s = “aab”
Output: [
  ["a","a","b"]
  ["aa","b"]
 ]

Explanation: There are two possible ways to partition the given string.
 1st: aa|b

aba

Sample Output 2:
[[a, b, a], [aba]]

Explanation Of Sample Input 2:
There are two possible ways to partition the given string.
 1st: a|b|a
 2nd: aba 

Sample Input 3:
aaaa

Sample Output 3:
a a a a 
a a aa 
a aa a 
a aaa 
aa a a 
aa aa 
aaa a 
aaaa 

Expected Time Complexity:
O(2^n * n^2), where n is the length of the given string.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 16
