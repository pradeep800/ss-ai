You are given a string 'str' of length 'N'.




Your task is to return the longest palindromic substring. If there are multiple strings, return any.




A substring is a contiguous segment of a string.




For Example :
str = "ababc"

The longest palindromic substring of "ababc" is "aba", since "aba" is a palindrome and it is the longest substring of length 3 which is a palindrome. 

There is another palindromic substring of length 3 is "bab". Since starting index of "aba" is less than "bab", so "aba" is the answer.
