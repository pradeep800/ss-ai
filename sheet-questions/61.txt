You are given two positive integers 'n' and 'm'. You have to return the 'nth' root of 'm', i.e. 'm(1/n)'. If the 'nth root is not an integer, return -1.




Note:
'nth' root of an integer 'm' is a number, which, when raised to the power 'n', gives 'm' as a result.





Example:
Input: ‘n’ = 3, ‘m’ = 27

Output: 3

Explanation: 
3rd Root of 27 is 3, as (3)^3 equals 27.

Sample Input 1:
3 27





Sample Output 1:
3





Explanation For Sample Input 1:
3rd Root of 27 is 3, as (3)^3 equals 27.





Sample Input 2:
4 69





Sample Output 2:
-1





Explanation For Sample Input 2:
4th Root of 69 is not an integer, hence -1.





Expected Time Complexity:
Try to do this in O(log(n+m)).





Constraints:
1 <= n <= 30
1 <= m <= 10^9

Time Limit: 1 sec.
