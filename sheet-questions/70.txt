Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given an array ‘Arr’ consisting of ‘N’ distinct integers and a positive integer ‘K’. Find out Kth smallest and Kth largest element of the array. It is guaranteed that K is not greater than the size of the array.
Example:
Let ‘N’ = 4,  ‘Arr’ be [1, 2, 5, 4] and ‘K’ = 3.  
then the elements of this array in ascending order is [1, 2, 4, 5].  Clearly, the 3rd smallest and largest element of this array is 4 and 2 respectively.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= K <= N
-10^9 <= Arr[i] <= 10^9

Where ‘T’ is the total number of test cases, ‘N’ is the size of array ‘Arr’ and Arr[i] is the element of the given array.

Time limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
2
4 4
5 6 7 2
4 3
1 2 5 4

Sample Output 1:
7 2 
4 2

Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
Test case 1:
Here, ‘N’ = 4, ‘Arr’ = [5, 6, 7, 2] and ‘K’ = 3.
Elements of the array in ascending order are [2, 5, 6, 7]
Thus the 4rd smallest and 4rd largest elements of this array are 7 and 2 respectively.

Test case 2:
See problem statement for an explanation.

Sample Input 2:
 2
 1 1
 2
 5 1
 5 4 3 2 1

Sample Output 2:
 2 2
 1 5
