You have been given a Binary Tree of 'N' nodes, where the nodes have integer values. Your task is to find the Pre-Order traversal of the given binary tree.
For Example :
For the given binary tree:


The Preorder traversal will be [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 7, 6].

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10
0 <= N <= 3000
0 <= data <= 10^9     

Where 'data' denotes the node value of the binary tree nodes.

Time limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1 :
2
1 2 3 -1 -1 -1  6 -1 -1
1 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 1 :
1 2 3 6
1 2 3

Explanation Of Sample Output 1 :
 In test case 1, the given binary tree is shown below:


Preorder traversal of given tree = [1, 2, 3, 6]

In test case 2, the given binary tree is shown below:


Preorder traversal of given tree = [1, 2, 3]

Sample Input 2 :
2
1 -1 -1
1 2 4 5 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 2 :
1
1 2 5 3 4

Explanation Of Sample Output 2 :
In test case 1, there is only one node, so Pre-Order traversal will be only [1].

In test case 2, the given binary tree is shown below:


Preorder traversal of given tree = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4]
