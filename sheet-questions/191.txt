Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given an array/list ‘ARR’ consisting of ‘N’ non-negative integers. You are also given a list ‘QUERIES’ consisting of ‘M’ queries, where the ‘i-th’ query is a list/array of two non-negative integers ‘Xi’, ‘Ai’, i.e ‘QUERIES[i]’ = [‘Xi’, ‘Ai’].
The answer to the ith query, i.e ‘QUERIES[i]’ is the maximum bitwise xor value of ‘Xi’ with any integer less than or equal to ‘Ai’ in ‘ARR’.
You should return an array/list consisting of ‘N’ integers where the ‘i-th’ integer is the answer of ‘QUERIES[i]’.
Note:
1. If all integers are greater than ‘Ai’ in array/list ‘ARR’  then the answer to this ith query will be -1.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N, M <= 10000
0 <= ARR[i], Xi, Ai <= 10^9

Where ‘T’ is the number of test cases, 'N' is the size of ‘ARR’, ‘M’  is the number of queries, ‘ARR[i]’ is an element of array/list ‘ARR’ and ‘Xi’, ‘Ai’ are the integers in ‘QUERIES[i]’.  

Time limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
2
5 2
0 1 2 3 4
1 3
5 6
1 1
1
1 0  

Sample Output 1:
3 7
-1

Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
In the first test case, the answer of query [1, 3] is 3 because 1^2 = 3 and 2 <= 3,  and the answer of query [5, 6] is 7 because  5 ^ 2 = 7 and 2 <= 6.

In the second test case, no element is less than or equal to 0 in the given array ‘ARR’.

Sample Input 2:
2
6 3
6 6 3 5 2 4
6 3
8 1
12 4 
5 2
0 0 0 0 0
1 0
1 1

Sample Output 2:
5 -1 15
1 1
