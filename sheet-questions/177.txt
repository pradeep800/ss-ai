Ninjaland is a country in the shape of a 2-Dimensional grid 'GRID', with 'N' rows and 'M' columns. Each point in the grid has some cost associated with it.
Find a path from top left i.e. (0, 0) to the bottom right i.e. ('N' - 1, 'M' - 1) which minimizes the sum of the cost of all the numbers along the path. You need to tell the minimum sum of that path.
Note:
You can only move down or right at any point in time.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100   
1 <= N, M <= 10^2
1 <= GRID[i][j] <= 10^5

Where 'GRID[i][j]' denotes the value of the cell in the matrix.

Time limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
2
2 3
5 9 6
11 5 2
1 1
5

Sample Output 1:
21
5

Explanation For Sample Output 1:
In test case 1, Consider a grid of 2*3:


For this the grid the path with minimum value is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2). And the sum along this path is 5 + 9 +5 + 2 = 21. So the ans is 21.

In test case 2, The given grid is:


For this the grid the path with minimum value is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2).The sum along this path is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 9 = 19.

Sample Input 2:
2
2 2
5 6
1 2
3 3
1 2 3
4 5 4
7 5 9

Sample Output 2:
8
19

Explanation For Sample Output 2:
In test case 1, For this the grid the path with minimum value is (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1). The sum along this path is 5 + 1 + 2 = 8.

In test case 2, The given grid is:


For this the grid the path with minimum value is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2).The sum along this path is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 9 = 19.
