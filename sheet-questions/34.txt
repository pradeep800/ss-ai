Problem Statement
Suggest Edit
You are given a singly Linked List of integers. Your task is to return true if the given singly linked list is a palindrome otherwise returns false.
For Example:
The given linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2-> 1-> NULL.

It is a palindrome linked list because the given linked list has the same order of elements when traversed forwards and backward​.

Follow Up:
Can you solve the problem in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity iteratively?

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10
0 <= L <= 10^5
1 <= data <= 10^9 and data != -1

Where L is the number of nodes in the Linked List.

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1 :
2
1 2 3 4 5 6 -1
1 2 1 -1

Sample Output 1 :
false
true

Explanation For Sample 1:
For the first test case, it is not a palindrome because Linked List doesn't have the same order of elements when traversed forwards and backwards​.

For the second test case, it is a palindrome linked list because a Linked List has the same order of elements when traversed forwards and backwards​.

Sample Input 2 :
2
1 -1
1 10 45 10 1 -1

Sample Output 2 :
true
true
